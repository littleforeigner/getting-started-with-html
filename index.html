<h1>The Basics of the Web & HTML</h1>

<h2>The Web</h2>

The World Wide Web was invented in early 1990s. It is basically a collection of, at the current time approximately 30 billion, HTML documents. Web pages are HTML documents that are read, interpreted and displayed by browsers on our computers. Hyperlinks - which can link one HTML document to another - contained within these documents are what make “the web weblike”.

<h3>Major Components of The Web</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your computer running a bowser to display files found on the web</li>
<li>The Internet - the world’s largest computer network</li>
<li>http - the main protocol of the web via which information is sent between your computer and servers</li>
<li>Servers - computers that host the files that make up the web</li>
</ul>

<h2>HTML</h2>

HTML is the basis for almost every web page and can be thought of as the “glue” that connects everything together.

<h3>Functions of HTML</h3>

<ul>
<li>Renders text <b>content we see</b> on web pages.
<li>Controls how content is presented via <b>markup</b> text that tells computers what to do in a language they understand.
<li>References other documents such as <b>images & video</b>.
 <li>Connectes web pages via <b>hyperlinks</b>.
</ul>

<h3>Components of HTML markup</h3>
HTML <b>elements</b> are made up of <b>tags</b>, <b>attributes</b> and <b>values</b>.

Eg in the anchor element <a href=“http://www.udacity.com”>Udacity</a>

<ul>
<li>a is the <b>opening tag</b></li>
<li>/a is the <b>closing tag</b></li>
<li>href is an <b>attribute</b></li>
<li>http://www.udacity.com is a <b>value</b></li>
</ul>

Void tags such as img and br do not require closing tags

<h3>Two kinds of HTML elements</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Inline</b> - no break up of page flow, do not force new lines before or after placement<br>
Examples include b, em, a, img & span.</li>
<li><b>Block</b> - preserves whitespace, new lines appear before and after the element<br>
Examples include p,  form, div</li>
</ul>
